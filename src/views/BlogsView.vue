                        That training consists of two parts, The first is the development part, 
                        I build a medical appointment web application to manage an clinic 
                        appointments and services. <br>
                        The second part is the network, and it was about learning more 
                        Networking skills like configuring switches, routers, and computer maintenance.

                        Thit is the second training, where i created a bunch of full-stack projects,
                        this training was different, Because it was a bunch of projects already build
                        and you have to update somewhere, It was a new experience that this training gives to me
                        when you can knows other ways of developers code.

                        That is the institute training, In fact it is my first training, <br>
                        I was afraid because i didn't have much experience at that time, <br>
                        They assigned me to build a large web application to manage the institute's activities.
                        It took from me about two months, But i learned a log even the quality of code and the
                        terrible mistakes.

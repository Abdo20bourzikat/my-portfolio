                    Hello, iam Abdo Bourzikat, i'm a 22 years old,
                    i'm a junior full stack web developer, i'm from Morocco,
                    and i live in Fes. <br><br>
                    I started learning programming in summer of 2022, the first what i learned 
                    was Algorithms, it took a lot of time from me, but it's important it gives
                    you more logic.
                    about my favorite programming language is <i>PHP</i> i guess because i have a tendencies
                    to the server side and it's a strong programming language.<br><br>
                    And about projects, guess what? the most programmers, when they think about their first project,
                    laugh a lot for their terrible mistakes and <i>DRY</i>,<br><strong>just kidding</strong> 
                    those mistakes are what we are now.<br><br>
                    My reel first project was about the institute activities, by the record this institute where i was study:), 
                    it's was a terrible website but it's work. :) <br>
                    Honestly i learned a lot of lot from this project. <br><br>
                    And if you were a beginners, try to build a many of projects,
                    that equals a great feeling, more confident, more productivity. <br>
                    About my free time, i learn other skills,
                    i watch series, and listen to music. <br>
                    Thank's For Your Reading.
